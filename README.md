# Keycloak OIDC demo

Docker compose file that spins up a Keycloak instance to aid going through the labs defined in the book Keycloak â€“ Identity and Access Management for Modern Applications, Second Edition.

The source code for the labs was obtained from the original GitHub repository dedicated to the book located [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Keycloak---Identity-and-Access-Management-for-Modern-Applications-2nd-Edition.git).

## Usage

While creating the docker compose file I was using Podman, but the podman commands should work perfectly fine with the Docker Engine by substituting `podman` with `docker`.
